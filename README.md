# Objectives/Points so far:

* Make prototypes to reflect the fun in a game, not a technical aspect
* Assume the worst presenting space when doing a presentation
* Work for at least 2 hours above normal sessions on a module each week to determine
* Build the game more frequently (every 2 days)
* Formalise communication between programmers and designers

# Goals from previous reports:

## Report 1

+ Quickly making the first iteration
+ Committing individual changes
+ Writing consistent pseudo-code
+ Holding daily stand ups with other active projects
+ Estimating how many tasks should go in a sprint


## Report 2

+ Informing the team of my work in progress
+ Allocating time proportionally between team and personal tasks
+ Establishing a clear pipeline early
+ Prototyping with minimal assets
+ Using C++ and reducing reliance on blueprints

# Weekly Reports

## Summer

For me the summer was very much work focussed with me returning to where I worked before uni, however my role was different. Using the coding logic learnt last year, I worked full time on an Ionic-based POS app which integrates with existing online Magento stores (the type of site I was building before). As a result, I have learnt a lot of angular and node JS, with a bit of objective-c and SQL. The agile working practice was closer to that of the first year game, so that has been further cemented with frequent use of branches and pull requests for code reviews. Admittedly, as a result, my more game related coding knowledge has not been worked on and this is something that I acknowledge and will need to focus on.

### Summary and Critiques
There's only so much I can beat myself up over working full time on a tech-relevant job. I still had free time, and, although I didn't feel much like working at the computer after 8 hours, I should've done something other than the world pitch.

## 25th - 29th September (Week 1)

### Comp210
We were introduced to the VR/AR usibility research project, with a reintroduction to github pages to document our research. I could mostly get the template done within the session due to past experience, but I would like to make some tweaks for full responsiveness.

### Comp220
This session eased us into graphics programming with a background of how to create an SDL window. Due to time constraints the OpenGL and triangle creation demo were posted in videos online. I have looked at the window one and am in the process of getting the openGL setup. I will try to get that working, do the triangle exercise and have a play around after. Since my C++ is not where I want it to be, this is not something I can hold back from and need to give it a lot of extra time.

### Comp230
The ethics and professionalism essay was introduced, with an exercise in realising and acknowleging our ethical perspectives. I got subjectivism, where there aren't universal moral principles and morals can change based on the situation. I think this is an accurate representation of my opinions. For the ethics and professionalism essay I can sense a trap of falling into emotive arguments as opposed to scientific, so I'll try and keep this in mind. I am going to get a proposal done for the next session based of some papers.

### Game Project
The game project has started off with our team having a group discussion which then split off into 3 smaller groups. In each group we briefly padded out a game idea and we will develop prototypes next week. This is a more promising start to last year, where there was no real prototyping and development started quite late.

### General Comments
I am going to try and sort out my time management so that I split my module time appropriately. Another focus will be to respect my free time and allow appropriate breaks so I don't burn myself out. In order to do this, I will avoid deviating from a 9-5 work schedule as much as possible. The exception will be this weekend and currently since there was some wasted time during the week and I want to get a plan sorted as early as possible.

### Summary and Critiques
Said what I did each week, not too much of note objective-wise since it's the first week.

## 2nd - 6th October (Week 2)

### Comp210
This week we carried out heuristic evaluations (HE) on games, coming up with 3 main points where the UI could be improved. I have now got to use my own game and carry out some HE and add the research to the website.

### Comp220
This week I applied a simple shader to my triangle, at the moment this module hasn't caused me too many issues, so I'll try and keep on top of it.

### Comp230
This week was and introduction to dialogues, I researched the computing disaster of the NHS dispatching. We then looked at what a dialogue was and carried out one about the computing disasters.

### Game Project
From the first 3 micro prototypes we picked our first one to prototype which was the Taco Truck. I prototyped the inside of the truck and the basics of picking up items, however in hindsight this was too much for a prototype and didn't help much. The prototype should be more abstract and try and reflect the main aspect of where the fun in the game will come from and there was no game in the prototype I made.

### General Comments
The 9-5 schedule has not been going to plan and I have been working on weekends to compensate for that. This is less about getting the work done and more about trying to routine myself, but so far it has not been successful.

### Summary and Critiques
Make a more valuable prototype, reflect the value in the game, not a technical aspect
Failing to routine my work into stable hours.

## 9th - 13th October (Week 3)

### Comp210
We had a lecture on HCI methods and types of data (qualitative and quantitative). For qualitative research I should be interviewing around 4 people in more depth about my game and plan out questions. For the quantitative I need to construct a survey and try and get more people to fill it out, I'll aim for around 15-20. I plan on getting this survey and my questions sorted by next week.

### Comp220
I got behind in this lecture due to technical issues, I will follow Brian's video and follow this up once I've done that. All good after the videos, more or less understanding what's going on now.

### Comp230
This week was the hand in for the proposal, initially I struggled to find sources initially, but I went a bit broader and managed to get 13 relevant onces. Based on the feedback, I need to focus my question down a little bit more and make it more specific to programming. The session consisted of 2 dialogues about representation and violence in video games and they went down interesting routes, it is clear from these that some people don't want to contribute so maybe it would be a good idea to bring along some postits or something to next week so we can get a wider contribution from people.

### Game Project
We've now moved over to the second prototype which is the wacky guns, I've done some basic player movement, Rob is on the gun script and Alex has done some enemy movement. This prototype is in danger of going the same way as the taco truck one, however since the USP is the gun mechanics it's hard not to do a 3D prototype. I'm drifting away from the idea of doing the RPG for the sake of it being overscoped and I think I will find this project the most fun to work on of the 3 and it seems to break into separate tasks quite nicely. I also cleaned up the repo and have got sorted svn ignore.

### General Comments
Last 2 weeks were a bit of a productivity slump, not to an extreme extent, but I know I could and should be doing more. I plan on catching up this weekend, as I have done with these write-ups, and move towards more consistancy next week.

### Summary and Critiques
Survey and questions weren't sorted out.
Didn't do the postit thing, funnily enough, a lot of the people who weren't contributing didn't turn up.
Almost got too invested in my own idea, was just able to break away from it, but try not to at the prototype stage. This wasn't exactly helped by being asked by one of the tutors to pick a favourite out of the games at this early stage.
This week started me off on a good footing for a clean svn repo, this has been kept up, I will need to keep an eye on the game's structure as it grows.
Less productivity is an issue, plan your time to stop this happening again.

## 16th - 20th October (Week 4)

### Comp210
Some data manipulation in this session using google sheets to make graphs. I'm confident with sheets so this isn't a concern. I have gathered some data for my game through play testing, just need to clean it up a bit and get it onto the website. For this I decided to use my global game jam since it is quick to play and also testers are less likely to hold back on the negatives since it took 2 days as opposed to the 6 month game project last year. Need to get a proposal together for next week and finish up the data collection.

The site is more or less finished and I have got all the data I need. I have 4 graphs currently and will look into what else I can gather from my research.

### Comp220
Getting a bit more mathsy in this module but I'm quite enjoying that aspect since I've come from that kind of background. Got a 2d square working and a 3d cube. Going to be working on using different shaders for different vertices for the rest of this week.

### Comp230
One of the dialogues was about workplace ethics so this covered my question of the effects of wellbeing on programmers.

### Game Project
With the gun prototype finished, we had a discussion about what project to go ahead with so we can start getting a presentation together. We've gone with the couch co-op driving/cooking game since that felt like the most unique and more of a challenge than the 3rd person shooter.

I have programmed a lot of the car physics this week and have got a lot more done than I thought I would. We should be able to show off the driving in the game pitch on Wednesday next week.

### General Comments
Feeling a lot more productive this week. This may partly be down to the game project properly starting or an improvement in my Unity coding. I have been commiting individual changes that I make, and I have told the team through trello and slack about what I'm up to. These were 2 points from a previous CPD which have seen improvement.

### Summary and Critiques
Possibly jumped too much into the driving mechanics early on, probably because I don't have much familiarity with unity and wanted to learn with something comfortable.
Program the part that makes the game the game to assess if it's fun.

## 23rd - 27th October (Week 5)

### Comp210
Submitted the UR website, finished in good time too and didn't feel rushed despite giving myself extra work by not starting off on the best foot. Part of this was down to it being my first research task and the main aim of this was to improve our research process, which I think I have acknowledged in the report. Despite this, I could have improved the research by looking ahead at the brief early on. Because of this, I have now printed out all of the module briefs and will read through them in the next few days to try and get an understanding of what's required. Forward planning is the issue here, printing off briefs and working out what's required early on is the solution...I hope.

### Comp220
This module isn't causing any issues at the moment. I got element buffers working and I think I understand them as well as the rest of the code so far. So far, all I've been doing is following the live coding, and I need to step away from that and find my own take on this project. There will be more room for doing so in the coming weeks when I come to refactor my code, for which I need to get a good understanding of C++ classes for. Can't let my work for this module die down in the studio week, I will try and plan time for how I'm going to manage next week's time.

### Comp230
No session due to pitches for which I have gone into detail for below.

### Game Project
Start of the proper sprints for the game project, pitch went well. My notes were on paper this time since I knew the presentation setting wasn't ideal (amber). Critisism from my last pitch was the lack of eye contact, this was caused by me not writing down the notes and having to use the screen in the bottom right of the room, and also not learning the presentation enough to remember it without notes.

I fixed the project after it having been opened and saved in the latest (wrong) version of unity, I was able to go back into the svn logs and revert it back to the last time I touched it. Future reverts should be quicker now I know the process, although I'm hoping I don't need to do this again.

With the start of the sprints we've had a peer crit session for acknowledging where team members need to improve. My feedback was to communicate with the team more, specifically the other programmers. I can see where this came from because, although I said what I was doing, I wasn't really keeping an eye on what the other 2 were doing. Turns out they were a little lost with their specific roles and how their code would interract with mine, which I wasn't able to help with because I didn't know/ask. For my own personal goal I planned to keep more up to date with what the team were working on, with an easily achievable task of setting my notifications on slack to all.

### General Comments
Having printed off my module briefs (cpd included) I have skimmed over the brief for this task. I should've known it was going to be essentially the same thing as last year, but anyhow, I'm going to have to go back and try and pick out the most important bits for each week and try to formalise my objectives and how to achieve them.

This is more than I need to be writing for each week, but at this point I'm finding it quite good to get everything down on "paper". Not only will this help with my objectives, but typing everything out gives me a good opportunity to reflect and prioritise tasks. I've realised trying to go 9-5 is not going to happen, although I have been finding my time to be a lot more well managed than last year. Being already settled into the various systems is helping.

### Summary and Critiques
From pitching feedback, I needed more eye contact and not to be kneeling(oops). I'd love to blame the room, but knowing the limitations ahead of time, I was able to write notes on bits of card and with rehersal, the game pitch was delivered a lot more confidently and professionally. There was also music in this pitch too and I was able to plan ahead and bring a portable speaker.
When presenting, prepare for any situation and bring backups for things. For audio, bring a speaker, practice presenting more and if I need notes, write them down.

## 30th October - 3rd November (Week 6)

### Game Project
Studio practice week this week so mostly been working on the game project, nothing really to note outside of what has been brought up in PO meetings.

### Summary and Critiques
Although this was the studio practice week, I probably should've done more work on other modules since there are some things that would be good to start earlier. Don't get blindsided by one module, keep up work for multiple ones. Work for at least 2 hours on each module outside of sessions (obviously do more, but just to get an idea of where the work should be getting put in).

## 6th October - 10th November (Week 7)

### Comp210
Starting to link papers together for the journal. Noticable sections are emerging and I will start branching off from the given material and finding my own papers. I will keep it within the topics I have found since there isn't much room for extra sections.

### Comp220
Lighting and materials, made notes in this session, but haven't implemented them yet. I need to be careful with falling behind on this module, but so far I feel like I'm following it. I need to start branching out and exploring things on my own.

### Comp230
Presented my ethics and professionalism essay proposal. This time I made immediate note of the feedback ready for the essay. It was a lot more useful doing this when it was fresh.

### Game Project
Didn't have a build until just before the PO meeting, make sure this is done, with builds possibly being done at the end of every day/ every 2 days. There is a discrepancy between my Trello hours logged and stand up hours, since I end up getting into working and flowing straight onto another tasks. This is a tricky issue to solve, since logging more on trello might actually mean I do less work.

### General Comments
Seem to be getting better at scholarly writing, the marks will show whether or not I am right.

### Summary and Critiques
Think about a way of logging hours on trello more accurately without sacrificing the amount of work done.

## 13th October - 17th November (Week 8)

### Comp210
Submission for research journal. This was a tricky one mainly because I wanted to focus more on the journals surrounding the psychology of VR. I was able to read a reasonable amount of papers and ended up really enjoying researching for this essay. Would've been able to reach a higher part of the rubric if I had started reading earlier. Look at briefs early, little bits over time is how I need to be working. Started working on my prototype this week too, spent a lot of time over the weekend since I found it very engaging. Taking photos and videos of my progress has been very useful since the design has changed a lot.

### Comp220
Submission for the maths library. This should've been started earlier with a collaboration with the class. Again this goes back to looking at submissions at the start of a semester and understanding what is needed. Pair programming with Alex helped a lot since we could have one person refering to documentation and another typing, both thinking about how to implement the code. We swapped roles a couple of times. Working on this has definitely improved my understanding of the maths behind graphics programming. Implemented a mouse controlled camera and was able to come up with a better solution for how it moves that a function which was suggested by someone. I think I'm in more of a position to develop my own project further, I just need to put the time in.

### Comp230
Ethics and professionalism essay, with a peer review of the drafts. I felt that the way I approached my essay allowed me to create a good flow and structure, but I will see when the feedback comes for that. Almost missed out on answering part of my question, but in reading it over I was able to rectify this. In future essays I will definitely try to structure it in a similar way if the response is good. Didn't get particularly useful advice in the peer review despite offering a lot myself, I'd have taken it as a compliment if I wasn't feeling like I was short changed.

### Game Project
Roast session, general response of my contribution to the game has been good. Work has depleted a little bit because of the various hand ins for other modules this week. I will try and make up my sprint hours once they are done. Communication in the team still appears to be an issue in the team, even with programmer/designer meetings since they take to long to be frequent enough for the kind of back and forth conversation that needs to be happening.

### General Comments
Essay hand in week has been relatively stress free. All essays were completed and handed in around 24 hours or more in advance, which is a much better way to work than last year.

### Summary and Critiques
Still falling a bit behind on the live coding videos after getting sidetracked by other things. I need to split up my modules and, unless it's obvious one needs more attention in a week, I will space this out evenly. If possible I will allow an hour after each session for working on something extra, this can now be done in the extra time we have been given for comp220. Come up with a way of communicating with designers in a quick manner.

## 20th October - 24th November (Week 9)

### Comp210
Tested my VR demo for the first time with the VR headset and demoed it in the session. I calibrated the size of objects and was able to make tweaks after the session to improve my design. It has come a long way over the weekend, but I need to do a lot more to fulfil what I am planning. This is now my highest priority module since the graphics submission is after Christmas.

### Comp220
Mostly followed lecture, really need to catch up on live coding videos though before it becomes an issue so I can resolve anything I need to before Christmas.

### Comp230


### Game Project
Put forward a new way of getting communication between designers and programmers. This involves designers writing a small 2/3 sentence google doc for one specific feature in the game and what they need to be able to edit the values of. This can then be commented on by programmers if more info is needed, which can then be responded to till there is enough info for the implementation to happen. Once coded, the public editable variables can be given back in the document for reference so the designer is able to make informed tweaks. Initial response from one of the designers was not positive, but I was able to convince them it was a good idea since the "1 page" contains a lot of surplus information for programmers as well as missing vital information out. It was also the case that it wasn't being pushed so changes made couldn't be seen, whereas the google docs 

### General Comments
Fell behind pretty drastically for the CPD tasks (hadn't written up since studio practice week). All caught up now, but really this shouldn't be happening. Prioritisation needs to be sorted, because I have been doing a lot of work so productivity isn't the problem here. My productivity has been way up this week, mainly with respect to the VR project, but also the game project. Comp220 is receiving the least time and this needs to be rectified.

### Summary and Critiques
To avoid falling behind on stuff like CPD write ups, make a note of tasks that need to be completed each week. I have made a personal trello board to break down what I need to do for each of the modules, which gives me a better idea of which things are a priority and how much I need to be doing. Might add a weekly task column for tasks that need to be done every week.
