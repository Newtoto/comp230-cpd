# Weekly Reports

## Summer

For me the summer was very much work focussed with me returning to where I worked before uni, however my role was different. Using the coding logic learnt last year, I worked full time on an Ionic-based POS app which integrates with existing online Magento stores (the type of site I was building before). As a result, I have learnt a lot of angular and node JS, with a bit of objective-c and SQL. The agile working practice was closer to that of the first year game, so that has been further cemented with frequent use of branches and pull requests for code reviews. Admittedly, as a result, my more game related coding knowledge has not been worked on and this is something that I acknowledge and will need to focus on.
