# Weekly Reports

## Summer

For me the summer was very much work focussed with me returning to where I worked before uni, however my role was different. Using the coding logic learnt last year, I worked full time on an Ionic-based POS app which integrates with existing online Magento stores (the type of site I was building before). As a result, I have learnt a lot of angular and node JS, with a bit of objective-c and SQL. The agile working practice was closer to that of the first year game, so that has been further cemented with frequent use of branches and pull requests for code reviews. Admittedly, as a result, my more game related coding knowledge has not been worked on and this is something that I acknowledge and will need to focus on.

## 25th - 29th September

### Comp210
We were introduced to the VR/AR usibility research project, with a reintroduction to github pages to document our research. I could mostly get the template done within the session due to past experience, but I would like to make some tweaks for full responsiveness.

### Comp220
This session eased us into graphics programming with a background of how to create an SDL window. Due to time constraints the OpenGL and triangle creation demo were posted in videos online. I have looked at the window one and am in the process of getting the openGL setup. I will try to get that working, do the triangle exercise and have a play around after. Since my C++ is not where I want it to be, this is not something I can hold back from and need to give it a lot of extra time.

### Comp230
The ethics and professionalism essay was introduced, with an exercise in realising and acknowleging our ethical perspectives. I got subjectivism, where there aren't universal moral principles and morals can change based on the situation. I think this is an accurate representation of my opinions. For the ethics and professionalism essay I can sense a trap of falling into emotive arguments as opposed to scientific, so I'll try and keep this in mind. I am going to get a proposal done for the next session based of some papers.

The game project has started off with our team having a group discussion which then split off into 3 smaller groups. In each group we briefly padded out a game idea and we will develop prototypes next week. This is a more promising start to last year, where there was no real prototyping and development started quite late.

### General Comments
I am going to try and sort out my time management so that I split my module time appropriately. Another focus will be to respect my free time and allow appropriate breaks so I don't burn myself out. In order to do this, I will avoid deviating from a 9-5 work schedule as much as possible. The exception will be this weekend and currently since there was some wasted time during the week and I want to get a plan sorted as early as possible.
