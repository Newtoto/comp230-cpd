# Workshop Notes

* Procedural - Make prototypes to reflect the fun in a game, not a technical aspect
* Dispositional - Assume the worst presenting space when doing a presentation
* Dispositional - Work for at least 2 hours over normal sessions on a module each week to determine where to spend the time
* Dispositional - Build the game more frequently (every 2 days)
* Interpersonal - Formalise communication between programmers and designers

* Cognitive - Tendancy to just jump in without much research into what I'm doing. Research topic for 30 minutes and write down key points before starting.
* Affective - Pay attention to reasons for productivity slumps.

## Definitions
* Dispositional - ability to manage time and remain disciplined
* Affective - ability to identify and manage different mental states and emotions
* Interpersonal - ability to communicate and organise activity with peers
* Cognitive - knowledge of programming languages or frameworks
* Procedural - ability to apply computing concepts and problem solving skills

## Smart Goals

* Interpersonal: There has been miscommuntication between programmers and designers resulting in a lack of clarity of what needs to be done. I will formalise communication by implementing a system of written google documents which can be commented on by both parties to request more information. I aim to involve a new designer each week in making a document, and then each following week I will aid another programmer in using the system after having tested out the process myself.
* Dispositional: I have a tendancy to shift my focus over to one module too much when the workload increases for it. On every Sunday, I will write down 2 hours worth of tasks to complete at a minumum for each module. At the end of the week I will be able to see if I have split my time appropriately to complete these tasks. This will also highlight other tasks that need to be done for each module, meaning that I won't be blindsided by the work on one module.
* Procedural: For the prototyping phase of my game project it was unclear what the gameplay felt like. During a prototype phase, I will write down 1 or 2 main player focussed user stories which will reflect the most important gameplay aspects. Each task will be based around these so my focus stays on programming the core of the game. My success will be determined if the user stories are fulfilled by the prototype.
* Cognitive: When programming in Unity I have just been jumping in and seeing what works, meaning that I restrict my ability to learn new features of the engine. When programming a new feature in a game I will watch at least 1 tutorial on how I could implement it. Any new functions or features of the engine that are used in the engine I will make a note of and research the documentation for. I aim to learn at least 1 new feature of the game engine I'm using each week.
* Affective: I have noticed 2 main productivity slumps, without knowing the reason behind them. The next time one of these productivity slumps occurs, I will write down factors that could be contributing to the decrease in work. I will then research how to alieviate in the long run one of the contributing factors each week, noting down further possible reasons if it occurs again.
